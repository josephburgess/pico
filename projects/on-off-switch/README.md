# On-off switch LED

This project is a simple example of how to turn an external LED on and off using the Raspberry Pi Pico. The LED is connected to GPIO pin 15 and a switch is connected to GPIO pin 13.

This project turns the LED on when the button is pressed and off when the button is pressed again.
